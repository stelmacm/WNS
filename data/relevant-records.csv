Papa had heard there were some caves over in the area  across from the &quot;Hello Bill!&quot; boathouse, so he was anxious to check it out.  
</p>
<p>Drove to the area - so great to see that there really are some areas of 'backwoods' in Massachusetts - and the kids sprinted out to try and make the easy find after we had parked just past the cache.  Cameron made the easy find and the mayhem was on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Papa, visibly disappointed his 'first to locate' streak was over, decided to search out the Monk's Cave, which provided our second search at this cache!  Wish we would've brought a flashlight to take a look around in the  'man-made' hole in the ground!  
</p>
<p>Ryleigh thought the cottage could use a new set of cards, so she left a puzzle, and Cameron decided he didn't really need anymore baseball cards, so he just hung on to his yo-yo from the earlier cache. </p>

<p>Interestingly, you got a life sentence here for attempted rape but only just over a year for attempted murder. Times have changed. I also learned that not only could you be branded with an &quot;A&quot; for adultery but also a &quot;B&quot; to your forehead for burglary and a &quot;C&quot; for...heck, I can't remember.

A corn snake hiding within a cavity in the wall.. He looked at me, I looked at him, (or her, not sure. Didn't get close enough to even bother trying!) So, i went away, still looking, before giving up, and walking down to the trail to find Wide-Glide's cache. When I saw the head peeking over the stone, at me, I had to get a close-up..  Smile!  Err.

<p>Came here without reading the cache page, name of cache, or hiking poles and sunglasses on my head so I placed the previous note just to be safe.</p>
<p>Awesome cache.  As I rounded the bend I felt like I was at Machu Picchu.  Another great treequest hide!  Exchanged TBs</p>
<p>First here in 5 months!!!  Would have been a lopng to to find me.  I tripped over a metal rod in tghe ground and almost to a header into one of the mines filled with water.</p>

Been wanting to check this place out.</p>
<p>While I do not know why the cache owner is banned, I do not like the caches being active when we cannot contact the owner.  I had techinical dificulties getting myself in the picture.  If I could have contacted the owner, I would have sent him the answers and explained why I was not able to get a picture with myself in it and asked permision to log it.  But I cannot do this.  So besides the picture of the entrance, I am also posting a scren shot of my OR 550T.  It shows my track there and it shows the picture icon at the dripstone entrance.  I have also uploaded a second screenshot that shows my track for Sept 4, 2010 to demostrate I was there on September 4, 2010.

Our destination was Harmonist Labyrinth, which has been a four+ year goal of ours, &amp; marking Posey County &amp; 12 additional counties off of our 2010 caching “to-do” list. As customary, we got sidetracked along the way, but we did manage to find caches in about a half-dozen or so counties. We had such a fantastic journey, which is what geocaching is all about - having an extraordinary time, finding fascinating places &amp; things, learning a little geology, bonding &amp; creating memories. Seeing N9TDC's face light up as he reminisced in Evansville &amp; Vincennes, towns he once called “home,” &amp; listening to him talk to old friends on his ham radio were reasons enough to take the trip - everything else we saw &amp; did was icing on the cake! We went to breakfast at one of N9TDC's favorite spots, the Kat-A-Corner, in Sullivan, Indiana, visited the breathtaking labyrinth in New Harmony, went to an awesome old cemetery &amp; Harmonie State Park, drove by N9TDC's very first apartment, got “glazed,” went to the Casino Aztar (which was, by far, the low point in our trip!), ate dinner at N9TDC's favorite early 1990's hang out, the Nisbet Inn in Haubstadt, Indiana, did a little fossil hunting, took a 70-minute tour of the awesome Marengo Cave (which was, by far, the high point in our trip!), saw a curious chainsaw garden which is featured in the book, Weird Indiana (well deserved) &amp; a limestone kiln &amp; walked a short way along the Knobstone Trail. I am glad I wasn't able to read all of Cav Scout's Marengo Cave description until after our visit, because I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have trekked anywhere in the dark that was the home of cave rats! Thank you so much to all of the cache owners for putting out &amp;/or creating your caches. You gave me the type of weekend that I believe weekends were made for! I apologize for logging all of our cache finds on the 7th! &gt;:(  /  0:-) </p>","Marengo Cave","https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave","United States",35,2,2010-01-01,NA,2010-01-01

We almost couldn't even find this cave?!?!  It is well-hidden!!!  Hiking along the Pine Mountain Trail today with RiverJeff finding a few earthcaches, including this one and a few regulars too :-)  These are my type of caches and we had a beautiful day!!!</p>
<p>This has to be my favorite part of the whole trail . . . like a little hidden hide-a-way in here.  We stopped and had lunch (out of the sun) and took a little break here . . . so pretty and peaceful, and besides I looooooove caves and earthcaches so this gets a favorite point from me.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for bringing me down this section of the trail.  It doesn't seem like alot people hike here-we didn't see anyone else the whole day?!?!  Thanks also for your informative write-up!!!</p>

I flew in with the old buzzard, Papafuz. The last time we did this, it was snowing and pretty cold. We did a little CITO at the Cave entrance, but generally the area was clean and just like mother nature intended it. <br />
I want to set the record straight. Just because Papafuz was first to have his picture taken at the Cave entrance doesn't mean he can to be the only FTF! He rushed up to the entrance just to see if any of his bat cousins were present! Much to his disappointment, there weren't any bats there but I think he enjoyed himself anyway!<br />

We encountered numerous muggles walking 4-foots, lots of ducks, a goose, fish, and a chipmonk. What impressed me the most was just how cold that air was coming from the mouth of the cave.

I could not locate them on any information posted within the building or on the sign outside.  There are no longer tours due to the White Nose Syndrome that is killing the bats.  That said, there are plenty of reasons to visit this site of which I provided many pictures for your enjoyment.  What I did not read, was to earn credit, I would need a picture with me and my GPS... one problem with that... My GPS was my iPhone which was also my camera... and I went alone.

The weather started out at 86 degrees and muggy. As the week progressed it cooled to 72 and fresh. I concentrated on EarthCaches and Virtuals and attempted to fill in more of my D/T matrix as well as all UP counties. I progressed from St. Ignace to the Soo, Pictured Rocks, Marquette, Houghton and the Keweenaw. Then I moved on to the Porcupine Mountains and along the southern edge of the peninsula from Ironwood back to the Straits. I spent 4 nights camping at our clean and beautiful state parks and averaged 24 caches per day for a total of 121.</p>

First, when I was driving where my navigation system told me to drive, I was very afraid to get stuck with the car in the mud. It was a standard rent car, not a suv.<br />
When the navigation system told we that I have to find the rest of the way somewhere off road, it was about 300m to go. There was no way through the forest, it was raining, everthing was wet. But I wanted to find the mine so I went through the forest with the help of my GPS. As you can see on the picture, I found it.<br />
And I had not forget to store the position of my car into the GPS before going to the mine, so I found my way back to the car.<br />
I was wet when I was back at my car but happy to have seen the mine, seriously a place which is not very often visited by tourist. Thank you fo showing me that place.<br />
