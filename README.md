# WNS
Batman has all the technology but won't even save his own kind

# Order of the scripts
- run the drake/make script (includes packages and plan.R)
- import all the data 
- gonna need wns-presence.R
- run coordinate-overlap.R
- read in shape files and define them for the scripts
- only if the shape file works nicely run county-fix.R
- spatial-weight-matrix.R
- geocache-weight.R
- finally run GLMmodelfitcavedata.R
- in future simrunnner.R will be needed but for now there will be no sim runner
