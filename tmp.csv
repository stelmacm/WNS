The day was perfect for the hike in; slightly overcast, few sprinkles, mild temps (compared to 100+ at home), and no bugs.  I've had this cache dog-eared for several months watching it from home base in anticipation of making the journey while visiting family this summer.  I found the trek in a little difficult walking on the old rail bed with the unevenly spaced ties.  We marveled at what it took to build the rail system back in the day without the use of heavy equipment available today.   Climbed the trail upward toward the bucket of helmets and skirted around the downed tree debris lying across the foot path.  It was slippery going with the moss covered rocks.  Explored an area fitting the description but came out empty handed.  My brother peeked into another opening and BINGO!  What a neat area to see.  Took foreign currency.  Left duck call &amp; billfold.

We were warned that we needed a skinny geocacher but the grandson is in Greensboro, NC. We'll have to wait till he comes back north next year  to help us retrieve it.  Auger Falls and the other falls in the area (Christine, Griffin and Jimmy creek falls)especially Austin Falls were spectacular after over 5&quot; of rain.

<p>Drove to the area - so great to see that there really are some areas of 'backwoods' in Massachusetts - and the kids sprinted out to try and make the easy find after we had parked just past the cache.  Cameron made the easy find and the mayhem was on.</p>

<p>Ryleigh thought the cottage could use a new set of cards, so she left a puzzle, and Cameron decided he didn't really need anymore baseball cards, so he just hung on to his yo-yo from the earlier cache. </p>

<p>Interestingly, you got a life sentence here for attempted rape but only just over a year for attempted murder. Times have changed. I also learned that not only could you be branded with an &quot;A&quot; for adultery but also a &quot;B&quot; to your forehead for burglary and a &quot;C&quot; for...heck, I can't remember.

I was amazed how wet the mine was! Wear a hat. And boots. The walls run with water, the ceiling drips with it. It hasn't rained much lately, so that has to be just the way it is (where does all that water come from? It's not below the water table). Gave it a deeply creepy ambience.

A corn snake hiding within a cavity in the wall.. He looked at me, I looked at him, (or her, not sure. Didn't get close enough to even bother trying!) So, i went away, still looking, before giving up, and walking down to the trail to find Wide-Glide's cache. When I saw the head peeking over the stone, at me, I had to get a close-up..  Smile!  Err.

<p>Walking up to the cave's entrance, I couldn't help but smile.  This certainly seemed like an awesome place to explore!  Alas, time would prevent a thorough examination of this cave and its passages.  I'd have to settle for making observations of the exterior.  Some questions remained unanswered, though, so I sought the help of an employee.  Answers were cheerfully given as was aid in taking a photograph at the entrance.  A few of the artifacts inside the gift shop were looked over before it was obvious Atomic Goat's Breath and I needed to continue on our way.  Thank you for highlighting this geographic feature!</p>

Im not new to caching, I'm just new at logging them.  I have been a tag-along(muggle) with a friend for about a year and she finally talked me into getting my own account. We got this one along with many others while on a run in the Cahokia/Dupo/Columbia area on a beautiful summer day. We needed to hit wally's for some wine so we figured we would grab a few in JB park.</p>
<p>We have been here a couple times caching in the past year, I think we got most of them between all the trips here. She sent in the answers last time when she logged it.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to set this up for folks like us, it's a nice way to spend the day with a great friend. </p>

<p>Brook,<br />
Be still,—be still!<br />
Midnight’s arch is broken<br />
In thy ceaseless ripples.<br />
Dark and cold below them<br />
Runs the troubled water,—<br />
Only on its bosom,<br />
Shimmering and trembling,<br />
Doth the glinted star-shine<br />
Sparkle and cease.<br />
Life,<br />
Be still,—be still!<br />
Boundless truth is shattered<br />
On thy hurrying current.<br />
Rest, with face uplifted,<br />
Calm, serenely quiet;<br />
Drink the deathless beauty—<br />
Thrills of love and wonder<br />
Sinking, shining, star-like;<br />
Till the mirrored heaven<br />
Hollow down within thee<br />
Holy deeps unfathomed,<br />
Where far thoughts go floating,<br />
And low voices wander<br />
Whispering peace.</p>

<p>While I do not know why the cache owner is banned, I do not like the caches being active when we cannot contact the owner.  I had techinical dificulties getting myself in the picture.  If I could have contacted the owner, I would have sent him the answers and explained why I was not able to get a picture with myself in it and asked permision to log it.  But I cannot do this.  So besides the picture of the entrance, I am also posting a scren shot of my OR 550T.  It shows my track there and it shows the picture icon at the dripstone entrance.  I have also uploaded a second screenshot that shows my track for Sept 4, 2010 to demostrate I was there on September 4, 2010.

Our destination was Harmonist Labyrinth, which has been a four+ year goal of ours, &amp; marking Posey County &amp; 12 additional counties off of our 2010 caching “to-do” list. As customary, we got sidetracked along the way, but we did manage to find caches in about a half-dozen or so counties. We had such a fantastic journey, which is what geocaching is all about - having an extraordinary time, finding fascinating places &amp; things, learning a little geology, bonding &amp; creating memories. Seeing N9TDC's face light up as he reminisced in Evansville &amp; Vincennes, towns he once called “home,” &amp; listening to him talk to old friends on his ham radio were reasons enough to take the trip - everything else we saw &amp; did was icing on the cake! We went to breakfast at one of N9TDC's favorite spots, the Kat-A-Corner, in Sullivan, Indiana, visited the breathtaking labyrinth in New Harmony, went to an awesome old cemetery &amp; Harmonie State Park, drove by N9TDC's very first apartment, got “glazed,” went to the Casino Aztar (which was, by far, the low point in our trip!), ate dinner at N9TDC's favorite early 1990's hang out, the Nisbet Inn in Haubstadt, Indiana, did a little fossil hunting, took a 70-minute tour of the awesome Marengo Cave (which was, by far, the high point in our trip!), saw a curious chainsaw garden which is featured in the book, Weird Indiana (well deserved) &amp; a limestone kiln &amp; walked a short way along the Knobstone Trail. I am glad I wasn't able to read all of Cav Scout's Marengo Cave description until after our visit, because I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have trekked anywhere in the dark that was the home of cave rats! Thank you so much to all of the cache owners for putting out &amp;/or creating your caches. You gave me the type of weekend that I believe weekends were made for! I apologize for logging all of our cache finds on the 7th! &gt;:(  /  0:-) </p>","Marengo Cave","https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave","United States",35,2,2010-01-01,NA,2010-01-01

We almost couldn't even find this cave?!?!  It is well-hidden!!!  Hiking along the Pine Mountain Trail today with RiverJeff finding a few earthcaches, including this one and a few regulars too :-)  These are my type of caches and we had a beautiful day!!!</p>
<p>This has to be my favorite part of the whole trail . . . like a little hidden hide-a-way in here.  We stopped and had lunch (out of the sun) and took a little break here . . . so pretty and peaceful, and besides I looooooove caves and earthcaches so this gets a favorite point from me.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for bringing me down this section of the trail.  It doesn't seem like alot people hike here-we didn't see anyone else the whole day?!?!  Thanks also for your informative write-up!!!</p>

I had mentioned this cache and that one day I wanted to get the smiley. After I read the description to the family my brother said that he would like to go see this area. So after breakfast on Saturday we headed off for the adventure. Now neither one of us is in the best of shape but we had the confidence to get this done. The morning was a little cool so we had our jackets on. That didn't last long. After going down several sections of stairs we came to a landing that had a nice flat rock to the side. That is where we left our jackets for the rest of the trip down. We decided if they were gone oh well. On and on we went. The day was gorgeous!!! We reached a point where he saw one of the caves and he  made the comment he wished he had a flashlight, he didn't so we continued on. After a while I got my phone out and realized we had gone past GZ. I commented that it would be really funny if the cave he looked at was GZ. We turned around and started the trek back. Yep, the cave he had looked at was GZ!!! And to make the adventure even better he was the one that spotted the cache. The morning was just wonderful!!! (And our jackets were still there). We passed a young lady that told us she walks those steps 3 time a day and sometimes 6 days a week! I'm just glad I made it down those steps and back up one time. Thanks so much for the adventure! Oh, and we did explore the cave which is my kind of cave.</p>","Soldier Cave","https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave","United States",469,19,2015-01-01,2015-01-01,NA

This cache has been on my radar for a long time.  When I moved to Springfield a little over a year ago, I started asking cachers at events what some of their favorite caches were - this is one that kept coming up over and over!  I was warned several times that it was one was not a cache to be taken lightly - don't do it right after it rains, it's not one recommended for someone who is overweight or out of shape, etc.  Well, as I am a pretty heavy girl, I'd initially told myself that when I lose 50lbs, going for this cache would be my personal reward.  Well... I still have those pounds, but I was in the area for the first time in a while.  I was really hoping to make this one find #500 by collecting other caches along the way, but as I got to the park, I knew I'd have time to EITHER get to 500 finds, OR find this cache - I chose the latter!</p>
<p>Getting though the grotto was really an incredible experience.  There was no water, so I liked seeing the picture of the waterfall that is there when there's been heavy rains.  I get why I was warned not to do this cache if I was out of shape - as soon as I started down those steps, I knew I'd hate myself in a little while.  But I really wanted to collect this smiley, so I persevered!  When I got to the cave, I'd misread the clue and thought that it said that the cache was right -inside- the cave.  I set down my geobag and unzipped it to retrieve my flashlight... only to find that I had apparently never returned it to my bag after my one and only night caching excursion!  ARGH!  Knowing I was NOT going to climb back up and down those steps to get it from my car, nor was I going to just shrug it off and pass on this find, I grabbed my camera and proceeded to use the flash to search every crevice and bump in this cave!  I probably spent a good half hour doing this, at least, and told myself half a dozen times that I was just going to have to give up and come back.  On a hunch, I checked outside the cave, and voila!  Nice, easy find which, as usual, I made much harder than it needed to be!  But no regrets - I would have had a blast exploring this cave even without me mixing up the hint!  I even made two little froggie friends in there. :)</p>
<p>As I predicted, I sort of hated myself when it came time to go back up those steps - I've had knee problems since I was a kid and I knew it would kill my knees.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I did not plead for death rather than climb another step - extra bonus of this cache was realizing that even though I haven't been dropping any pants sizes, geocaching adventures like this have really been helping to improve my health and fitness!  So happy I had the opportunity to go after this one!  I can definitely tell why so many people recommended it!

We were hoping to catch a glimpse of some bats... but none were to be seen. It's unfortunate that they have closed to caves to public access/tours. This whole park is a beautiful place. We encountered numerous muggles walking 4-foots, lots of ducks, a goose, fish, and a chipmonk. What impressed me the most was just how cold that air was coming from the mouth of the cave. We really enjoyed our visit here.

I found out that the old one was retired, and this one was started.  Looking at the requirements I found the three questions and went to find the answers... I could not locate them on any information posted within the building or on the sign outside.  There are no longer tours due to the White Nose Syndrome that is killing the bats.  That said, there are plenty of reasons to visit this site of which I provided many pictures for your enjoyment.  What I did not read, was to earn credit, I would need a picture with me and my GPS... one problem with that... My GPS was my iPhone which was also my camera... and I went alone.

When we got close to GZ we heard this familiar growl that we've heard on the trail before and sure enough it was the Grizzly Kid hanging on the side of a rock, with a grin on his face. He said &quot;I'm inspecting these rocks, what are ya'll doing?&quot; It's always a fun adventure when we cross geo paths with the Kid......Thanks</p>

The weather started out at 86 degrees and muggy. As the week progressed it cooled to 72 and fresh. I concentrated on EarthCaches and Virtuals and attempted to fill in more of my D/T matrix as well as all UP counties. I progressed from St. Ignace to the Soo, Pictured Rocks, Marquette, Houghton and the Keweenaw. Then I moved on to the Porcupine Mountains and along the southern edge of the peninsula from Ironwood back to the Straits. I spent 4 nights camping at our clean and beautiful state parks and averaged 24 caches per day for a total of 121.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this little stop along the way. I was fun and interesting to pick through the tailings. Thank you for the learning experience and maintaining your EarthCache. I enjoyed it very much.

The weather started out at 86 degrees and muggy. As the week progressed it cooled to 72 and fresh. I concentrated on EarthCaches and Virtuals and attempted to fill in more of my D/T matrix as well as all UP counties. I progressed from St. Ignace to the Soo, Pictured Rocks, Marquette, Houghton and the Keweenaw. Then I moved on to the Porcupine Mountains and along the southern edge of the peninsula from Ironwood back to the Straits. I spent 4 nights camping at our clean and beautiful state parks and averaged 24 caches per day for a total of 121.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this stop and a chance to view the mine up close. Thanks for the chance to do that. I had the place to myself this morning and took a walk on the enormous pile of mine tailings. The answers have been mailed. TFTF</p>

This year it is a solo, whirl-wind trip to the Upper Peninsula to hit some very select caches to fill in counties and DeLorme pages and visit some places I really wanted to see. Day two took me further west and north. On my way back from Lake of the Clouds I stopped to visit the mine. Interesting little opening in the side of the mountain - made me wonder just how difficult mining was so long ago. I thought the bat habitat would have this one gated off.</p>

First cache for 2013 and the very first cache traveled to by XC Skiing.  Skied from the Whitetail Cabin Parking Lot, up M-107 approx 4 miles uphill to the earthcache.  There was a bitter wind right into my face most of the way up.  Met 3 young men from Ann Arbor, MI who were hiking to Government Peak and another young man who was mt. biking up to Lake of the Clouds.  Then met two snowmobilers.   This certainly was a great adventure finding the cache in the winter months at the Porkies.   The mine opening provided a nice warm place to rest before descending the hill back to the car.  I was on no-wax skis and this took about 1 hour to ascend and 45 min to descend.   The wind did make this a bit more challenging than I thought when starting the trip.

Off we went to stage 2. We had a nice walk, even though it was pretty hot out (I missed the natural air conditionong we had at stage 1!). We got to the second cave and got down to searching. I investigated one spot and couldn't believe my eyes...was it? Could it be? IT WAS!!! I brought the container out into the light so that we could investigate the contents and happily sign the log.

I was camping across the river from here for the GeoWoodstock event. I couple of days ago I attempted this one with Peppermill 6-Pack, OCIFI and ChileHead. We mostly failed on our attempt. We did manage to locate the entrance and enjoyed exploring some of the cave. The cool air on this hot day felt really nice, but we didn't come up with any coordinates. With guests on their way we headed off to our campsite for the evening. I stopped by again with my daughter, Frogize, on our way out of town today to give it one more shot.

A couple of the photos showed the second stage &quot;cave&quot; and guess what, I was right next to it yesterday but didn't find a way to climb up in it. So, I was the only person in the whole area at 8:00 am this morning. Went to the stage one cave and managed to fit myself in the first room, turned around and saw the &quot;crack&quot; for the second room, but could not fit through there at all. No wonder nobody I was with yesterday found the coordinates for the second stage, they were looking in the first room. I decided to give the second stage a try anyway by following the track on my GPSr. I ended up falling off a five foot high boulder face first, only injuring my right middle finger and getting scratches on my neck and left arm. I thought that I broke my finger, but I wasn't going to let my injuries stop me, so I managed to get to the entrances to the second stage &quot;caves&quot;. It wasn't three caves, but a boulder tunnel made from three boulders and a cave to each side. I checked the tunnel, nothing. I check the cave where I climbed up at and guess what, I FOUND THE CACHE!!!<br />
The lesson I learned from this is don't rush, take your time and keep looking at your surroundings for possible dangers. My finger isn't broken, but it sure is a darker shade of purple and spreading. Plenty of ice, finger splint and it should be fine in a few weeks (I hope). The cache was nice, but I enjoyed the adventure more (falling and all). TFTC! TFTA!!!</p>

I had trouble understanding the hint back then which caused me to spend a lot of time looking in the completely wrong area (the wide room to the right when you walk straight back). I noticed there are logs from the CO that describe pretty well where to go, but they are really old and I doubt most people read through all the ancient logs. Maybe the hint should be changed and just explain that it is the tight corridor to the left at the end of the first &quot;main&quot; corridor. It seems like there are a lot of DNFs just because people can't figure out where to go, since there is no GPS reception in a cave.</p>
<p>I made last minute plans to head up to GWIX this year and this cache was high on my priority list. I had been back here many times since 2006, but mostly had AGT on my agenda so I never got back to this one. Now that I'm done with the AGT I can concentrate on the other really awesome caches in the area. I was psyched to see that maintainence was done on this cache and that I might be able to find it. I saw that a few people had found the final using the force, and I brought a picture from the gallery along just in case I needed to do that, but now that I have been to the final, I'm pretty suprised that anyone was able to just find it like that. It seemed pretty far out there and not all that obvious to just stumble upon <img src=""/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif"" border=""0"" align=""middle"" />.</p>
<p>I was extremely late to the Kinzua Beach Bash event but ran into a few northern NJ and New York cachers I knew, and The Leprechauns from the Pittsburgh area who I just met, and we all teamed up to find this one. I left my car at the beach and grabbed a ride up with The Leprechauns so I could hike the trail back down to the beach afterwards. Even though it had been many years since my last visit I knew where to turn after we descended the stairs. Such a cool area! We got to the cave entrance and I was thrilled to feel the cold air condtioner- like air emanating from it since I was sweating like a beast <img src=""/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif"" border=""0"" align=""middle"" /> Very nice.  I would like to think the cave shrunk, but I guess I have gained weight since my last visit, as it definitely seemed like a tighter squeeze than I remembered. Once we all squished in there I was pretty sure where we needed to go. The Leprechauns led the way into the tighter chamber, and he found Stage 1 quickly but I felt the need to squeeze in there to check it out anyway. I did hit my head on the rock at some point so its probably not a bad idea to wear some sort of caving helmet or bike helmet, but it was okay. We gathered the needed numbers and were off after collecting headlamps and flashlights that some of the team lent to a few kids so they could check out the cave.</p>
<p>The hike to the second cave was a little tricky with some bushwacking and uneven ground but eventually we ended up sort of on a trail. I recognized the cave from the gallery photos and thought the side rooms would be off the main overhang so a bunch of us climbed up. We soon realized that was wrong and headed back down but The Leprechauns continued to do a very thorough analysis of the upper area just in case <img src=""/images/icons/icon_smile_tongue.gif"" border=""0"" align=""middle"" /></p>
<p>Brian went in to the first side room/chamber we found after slithering past a large boulder and found the cache very quickly. We all signed in and took some pictures and of course I had to put it back so I could check out the room. There was some weird stuff/pellets on the floor that looked like it came from a deer, but maybe an oppossum or racoon or something...I'm not sure.

<p>Trowel32 was back to rectify a DNF, and you don't get in the way of Laura on a mission. There were some pretty scary steps to go down and I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of going back up them. Anyway the first cave was found shortly and people started going in. Realizing they couldn't get through with their packs on they started handing them out. It was finally my turn and as I got to the larger part of the cave, Olga was struck with claustrophobia and I had to go out to let her back out too. Finally went back in and had a look around, so nice and cool in there! Meanwhile the others had found part one and gotten the coordinates to part two so once we retrieved all our gear and the headlamps and flashlight that Skigirl and I lent to some young lads, off we went. Another fairly short walk.</p>
<p>Getting up wasn't easy nor was getting down! The Ed part of Edgrac was kind enough to toss over the log to sign.

<p>The steep staircase carved into the side of the cliff was an outstanding introduction to the cache. It was a unique experience in and of itself. </p>

Knew it was supposed to be replaced sometime this weekend, but since we didn't have cel/internet reception at our campsite over at Dew Drop, couldn't check the notes to see if it had been yet. Really enjoyed the hike to this cache, what an awesome scenic area. Circled our way around and finally spotted the stairs we were looking for. The 4 of us squeezed our way thru and searched for the 1st WP. Sadly, we didn't find it (wish we had seen the new note on the cache so we would have known what to do and what to look for!). Thought about just looking around for the final area, but ran out of time, had to get back to camp becausue some guests were coming for smores at 8 and it was 7:40 now. Even tho this was a DNF for me, and I would have loved coming back the next day with TazD, but had to head south to Tennesee. I loved the area and it was worth it even without a smiley. I hope to get back again someday.  Thanks!</p>

<p>So ElectroQTed, LadyQT and ourselves headed to Stage 1. Of course, our first try got us within 5 meters, but our approach from the top didn't work out so well. A bit of re-reading and re-verticalization ensued, and then it was time to enter the first cave.</p>
<p>It took us a couple of tries at stage 1 -- there a lot of other (non-caching)  people around today who also wanted to visit the cave, so we had to let them enjoy the cool darkness too. </p>
<p>We almost gave up, but Ted persevered and came up with the goods. The second stage was easy enough, and it was nice to leave the crowds far behind and have the area of the final to ourselves.</p>

What a great adventure! I found cave #1 and had a great time exploring and climbing around in the dark. I planned ahead and brought my headlamp and some flashlights. The area was really busy with memorial day weekend and I got a lot of strange looks and questioning glances from muggles as I entered the cave. One nice gentleman was concerned when I didn't come out right away and called in to me. He was astounded that anyone would venture in so far. As the previous logs point out, stage one must be missing. The only thing I found was an engraving from October of 1970 and various 'holes' in the stone (possibly to hold torches?). Well, I don't have any indian blood in my geneology, but I chose to follow in the last cachers footsteps and used the cache description as a guide. Using the context clues and some stubbornness (that is in my geneology), I was able to find the set of caves mentioned and ultimately the cache. I have to say, after hiking from the beach at bottom of the mountain, I sure was glad to make this find. The cache container is in pretty bad shape. It looks like an animal had a good time chewing at the bottom of it. I removed the 'nasty' swag and left only the swag that was not moisture damaged. I added an additional ziplock to double bag the contents. Thanks for this EPIC find; I will be posting pictures of my adventure as soon as I get home. My only regret is not having someone go with me on this cache; this is definately a cache I want to share. Thanks again and happy caching!!!</p>","Cornplanters Cave Cache","https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache","United States",186,8,2011-01-01,NA,2011-01-01

I have some Indian blood maybe that helped me.By following the clues and check out the gallery of pictures you will see the picture of the cache cave. Believe me you wont miss it. This is a terrain of 4 that it is be careful. It really is not that hard to find.Get a Topo map and read the clues. I found it in ten minutes from leaving the car. If you want the coordinates for the final cache, post a picture of yourself with the Rim Rock sign in the picture gallery add your username. Then send me an email that you would like the cords for Cornplanters Cave Cache i will gladly share them with you. Good Luck and have fun exploring.

First, when I was driving where my navigation system told me to drive, I was very afraid to get stuck with the car in the mud. It was a standard rent car, not a suv.<br />
When the navigation system told we that I have to find the rest of the way somewhere off road, it was about 300m to go. There was no way through the forest, it was raining, everthing was wet. But I wanted to find the mine so I went through the forest with the help of my GPS. As you can see on the picture, I found it.<br />
And I had not forget to store the position of my car into the GPS before going to the mine, so I found my way back to the car.<br />
I was wet when I was back at my car but happy to have seen the mine, seriously a place which is not very often visited by tourist. Thank you fo showing me that place.<br />

First, the river, which was quite low. We took off our boots and waded across in the chilly water. Then up we went, but... Momma Crow does not like heights so much; it was a challenge for her to get to the top. And getting back down, well, let's just say it was baby steps all the way for her! We used to hear about this as a popular party spot back when we were in high school, and it doesn't look like much has changed in the (few) years since then. On our way back out, we decided to leave the boots on and looked for a likely spot to cross the river. Apparently, waterproof boots only work if you don't completely submerge them. LOL. Thanks for the info on how this cave was formed; sometimes we don't know much about the treasures in our own back yard. Thanks for the adventure.

<p>Walking up to the cave's entrance, I couldn't help but smile.  This certainly seemed like an awesome place to explore!  Alas, time would prevent a thorough examination of this cave and its passages.  I'd have to settle for making observations of the exterior.  Some questions remained unanswered, though, so I sought the help of an employee.  Answers were cheerfully given as was aid in taking a photograph at the entrance.  A few of the artifacts inside the gift shop were looked over before it was obvious Atomic Goat's Breath and I needed to continue on our way.  Thank you for highlighting this geographic feature!</p>

Im not new to caching, I'm just new at logging them.  I have been a tag-along(muggle) with a friend for about a year and she finally talked me into getting my own account. We got this one along with many others while on a run in the Cahokia/Dupo/Columbia area on a beautiful summer day. We needed to hit wally's for some wine so we figured we would grab a few in JB park.</p>
<p>We have been here a couple times caching in the past year, I think we got most of them between all the trips here. She sent in the answers last time when she logged it.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to set this up for folks like us, it's a nice way to spend the day with a great friend. </p>

<p>Brook,<br />
Be still,—be still!<br />
Midnight’s arch is broken<br />
In thy ceaseless ripples.<br />
Dark and cold below them<br />
Runs the troubled water,—<br />
Only on its bosom,<br />
Shimmering and trembling,<br />
Doth the glinted star-shine<br />
Sparkle and cease.<br />
Life,<br />
Be still,—be still!<br />
Boundless truth is shattered<br />
On thy hurrying current.<br />
Rest, with face uplifted,<br />
Calm, serenely quiet;<br />
Drink the deathless beauty—<br />
Thrills of love and wonder<br />
Sinking, shining, star-like;<br />
Till the mirrored heaven<br />
Hollow down within thee<br />
Holy deeps unfathomed,<br />
Where far thoughts go floating,<br />
And low voices wander<br />
Whispering peace.</p>

I brought my Mother to Branson this weekend to meet up with my brother and sister-n-law to celebrate our Mother's 90th birthday.  I had mentioned this cache and that one day I wanted to get the smiley. After I read the description to the family my brother said that he would like to go see this area. So after breakfast on Saturday we headed off for the adventure. Now neither one of us is in the best of shape but we had the confidence to get this done. The morning was a little cool so we had our jackets on. That didn't last long. After going down several sections of stairs we came to a landing that had a nice flat rock to the side. That is where we left our jackets for the rest of the trip down. We decided if they were gone oh well. On and on we went. The day was gorgeous!!! We reached a point where he saw one of the caves and he  made the comment he wished he had a flashlight, he didn't so we continued on. After a while I got my phone out and realized we had gone past GZ. I commented that it would be really funny if the cave he looked at was GZ. We turned around and started the trek back. Yep, the cave he had looked at was GZ!!! And to make the adventure even better he was the one that spotted the cache. The morning was just wonderful!!! (And our jackets were still there). We passed a young lady that told us she walks those steps 3 time a day and sometimes 6 days a week! I'm just glad I made it down those steps and back up one time. Thanks so much for the adventure! Oh, and we did explore the cave which is my kind of cave.</p>","Soldier Cave","https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave","United States",469,19,2015-01-01,2015-01-01,NA

This cache has been on my radar for a long time.  When I moved to Springfield a little over a year ago, I started asking cachers at events what some of their favorite caches were - this is one that kept coming up over and over!  I was warned several times that it was one was not a cache to be taken lightly - don't do it right after it rains, it's not one recommended for someone who is overweight or out of shape, etc.  Well, as I am a pretty heavy girl, I'd initially told myself that when I lose 50lbs, going for this cache would be my personal reward.  Well... I still have those pounds, but I was in the area for the first time in a while.  I was really hoping to make this one find #500 by collecting other caches along the way, but as I got to the park, I knew I'd have time to EITHER get to 500 finds, OR find this cache - I chose the latter!</p>
<p>Getting though the grotto was really an incredible experience.  There was no water, so I liked seeing the picture of the waterfall that is there when there's been heavy rains.  I get why I was warned not to do this cache if I was out of shape - as soon as I started down those steps, I knew I'd hate myself in a little while.  But I really wanted to collect this smiley, so I persevered!  When I got to the cave, I'd misread the clue and thought that it said that the cache was right -inside- the cave.  I set down my geobag and unzipped it to retrieve my flashlight... only to find that I had apparently never returned it to my bag after my one and only night caching excursion!  ARGH!  Knowing I was NOT going to climb back up and down those steps to get it from my car, nor was I going to just shrug it off and pass on this find, I grabbed my camera and proceeded to use the flash to search every crevice and bump in this cave!  I probably spent a good half hour doing this, at least, and told myself half a dozen times that I was just going to have to give up and come back.  On a hunch, I checked outside the cave, and voila!  Nice, easy find which, as usual, I made much harder than it needed to be!  But no regrets - I would have had a blast exploring this cave even without me mixing up the hint!  I even made two little froggie friends in there. :)</p>
<p>As I predicted, I sort of hated myself when it came time to go back up those steps - I've had knee problems since I was a kid and I knew it would kill my knees.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I did not plead for death rather than climb another step - extra bonus of this cache was realizing that even though I haven't been dropping any pants sizes, geocaching adventures like this have really been helping to improve my health and fitness!  So happy I had the opportunity to go after this one!  I can definitely tell why so many people recommended it!

The total finds at the end of day wasn't high, but the quality of caches was good and many of the locations provided some added interest and/or fun to our searches. The Lakeside Wilderness was our last place to cache today and is a great location.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, looks like our timing wasn't good for this one.
