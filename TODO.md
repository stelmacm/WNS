## TODO

- derivation showing that model with background infection is *not* linear in the parameters on the cloglog scale: $(1-(1-p_c)^n)(1-p_b)$ where $p_c$ is per-cave-contact transmission probability and $p_b$ is background infection prob 
- import GLM/GLMM fits into repo
- simulation model
- figure out weight matrix stuff ...
