This is going to be the new journal of stuff I do instead of using Adrian's repo because it's just a little messy.
I also have 95% of my things written on paper and that is not a good thing so I should import that onto here.

## Feb 17th
- Very confused how everything is working due to organization of repo so I'm just gonna do my own thing and 
keep in touch with Adrian and send eachother scripts
- Need to redo GLM script because there is something wrong and it doesnt work

## Feb 18th
- Probelem is with spacial weight matrix (adjacency matrix)
- Problem is probably very simple but I cant figure it out. Adrain is working on it as well
- Not really sure how to figure it out. 
- Adrain figured it out...

## Feb 19th 
- Adrain fixed adjacency matrix and put it in long format. Had to change alot of coord script and coord overlap
- Changing up the GLM model. 
- GLM is not converging. I have incidence factored but I feel like it isnt actually
- Adrian figured out that it wasnt actually and data was not melted properly
- GLM(incidence ~ num.shared + county1 + date, data = all.shared.users, family = binomial(link = "cloglog")
- Should date and county be used as offsets instead????

## Feb 20th
- How do I interpret lambda's and exp-growth-rate.png 
- And what do I do with county1 + date
- Can I make more graphics for this model? Visualizations are v helpful
