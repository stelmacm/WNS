### What am I doing with my life (and this project)

## Week of March 22nd

- Reading about RandomFields package
- Played around with several examples from Wash. State Uni
- These examples were mostly Gaussian Spatial Autocorrelation simulations
- Cool Examples but still need to learn the more spatially intensive versions
- Read https://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2020/03/11/1914794117.DCSupplemental 
- I think this is a cool interesting paper which tells us about the characteristics of the disease and should tell us some info
  about what to do with SIR or SIS or SIRS decisions and assumptions
- Trying exaples of Seedy (epi package) for networking disease
- I keep finding myself convinced that the answer for all my questions is in https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/projects/ but I just
  don't know in which
- Uploading Proof for Ben
- Played around with spreadr but its probably not it but just interested me 
- Ran through Ben's examples in spatial and spatial_lab (Summary: Stuff I probably should have looked at first that summarizes everything
  I have just done up there ^)
-Forgot to push this yesterday. oops. Need to get better with pushing
